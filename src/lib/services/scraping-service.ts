    EuroCorp's CEO, Anya Sharma, announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing today from their headquarters in Geneva.
    The project, codenamed "Prometheus," was developed in a secret research facility, known only as Site-7, located in the Swiss Alps.
    This development poses a significant challenge to their main competitor, OmniCorp, whose stock price dropped by 15% following the news.
    Ms. Sharma stated, "This is a pivotal moment for EuroCorp and for technology as a whole."
    The technology was co-developed with researchers from the Zurich Institute of Technology.
    John Peterson, a former OmniCorp engineer who now works for EuroCorp, was reportedly the lead architect of the new quantum processor.
    The announcement was made during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos.
